# Contributing to Trip Data Analysis and Clustering

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Trip Data Analysis and Clustering** project!  
This open-source repository focuses on analysing trip or travel dataset(s) and applying clustering techniques to discover patterns and insights from movement or journey data. Every contribution — whether small or large — is warmly welcomed.

## 🚀 How You Can Contribute

- **Data & Feature Enhancements**: Add or extend datasets for trip records (e.g., origin-destination data, travel time, mode of transport, distance), improve data cleaning, enhance feature engineering (e.g., time-of-day, day-of-week, route length, speed, stops).  
- **Clustering & Analysis Improvements**: Experiment with different clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical, HDBSCAN), optimise cluster count, validate cluster quality, segment trips into meaningful groups, and interpret them in business or travel-analytics context.  
- **Visualization & Dashboards**: Create clear, engaging visualisations or interactive dashboards (e.g., heat-maps of routes, trip clusters on maps, cluster summaries over time) that highlight key insights and support decision-making.  
- **Documentation & Tutorials**: Improve the README, add step-by-step walkthroughs, annotated notebooks, code comments, and usage examples so newcomers can understand and run the analysis.  
- **Bug Fixes & Code Optimisation**: Fix issues in scripts or notebooks, refactor code for readability, improve reproducibility, ensure notebooks run seamlessly and results are consistent.
